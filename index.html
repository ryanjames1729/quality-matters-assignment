            The Altamont School is a coeducational college preparatory independent day school enrolling students in grades 5-12. We are located on the crest of Red Mountain in a secluded residential neighborhood five minutes from downtown Birmingham.
            <br><br>
Altamont is a small family with socio-economic, ethnic and religious diversity. We have an intensive college preparatory academic program with a personalized college search program, including an annual college tour. Altamont offers many opportunities for children to develop multiple talents by participating in arts, world languages, community service, clubs, class projects, science competitions and sports.
            <br><br>
Altamont was established in 1975 through the merger of the Birmingham University School (BUS), founded in 1922, and the Brooke Hill School, founded in 1941 as the College Preparatory School for Girls.
            <br><br>
Our main campus is located on 28-acres on the crest of Red Mountain in a secluded residential neighborhood five minutes from downtown Birmingham. The main school building houses 40 classrooms, two science wings, a Fine Arts Center, a Student Center, an art gallery and sculpture garden, a complete computer network with a wireless hub, a computer lab, a 15,000-volume library, and special studios for choir, art, photography, and orchestra, and an audio-visual recording, editing and production studio. The athletic facilities include two gymnasiums with two basketball courts, three volleyball courts, a weight training facility and a sports medicine classroom. The main campus offers six tennis courts, a soccer field and a track with discus cage, shot put ring, long jump pit, pole vault, and a golf cage. A second campus provides another gymnasium as well as soccer, baseball, and softball fields.
